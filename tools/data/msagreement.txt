Lattice Semiconductor would like to collect data on what software messages are being generated for your design. This information is completely anonymous and only consists of program name generating the message, the message ID, and the number of times the message occurred. Allowing this data to be collected will allow Lattice to better prioritize which messages need more content developed helping customers complete their designs easier and faster.
