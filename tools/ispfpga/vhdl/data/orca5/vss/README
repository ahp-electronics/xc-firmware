NOTE:

o Make sure that the ORCA Foundry CD has been installed
  properly and that variable FOUNDRY has been setup.

o To use VSS for VITAL'95 simulations, you require to
  have Synopsys version 3.4b or above. Please contact
  your Synopsys rep. for an upgrade. 

This directory contains a script for compiling the VITAL'95 
source files for ORCA 4E Cells. It also contains a 
dotsynopsys_vss.setup file which should be copied into your 
.synopsys_vss.setup file before compiling the libraries and 
later into your design/simulation directory. This sets up the 
library path ORCA4 pointing to the compiled ORCA libraries.

The files in these dir are:

README			: This file
dotsynopsys_vss.setup  	: Synopsys VSS Setup file
init.csh		: Initiallization Script to check
			  that variables FOUNDRY has been
			  set and VSS installed.
orc_cmpl.csh		: ORCA Cell VITAL'95 library compile
			  script.
