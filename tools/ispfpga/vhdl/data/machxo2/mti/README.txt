Please enable integration of black box modules into the machxo2 library,
by uncommenting the related command lines in the .bat/.csh file.

NOTE: For MS Windows users the unzip command is usually unavailable, hence:
first uncompress the black-boxes file using WinZip (or equivalent tool), then
copy or move the unzipped folder into this folder, then run the modified batch file.
