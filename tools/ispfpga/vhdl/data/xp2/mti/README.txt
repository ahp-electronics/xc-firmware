If you have a mixed-HDL license, you can integrate the JTAGE/SSPIA black-box models
into the XP2 library, by uncommenting the related command lines in the .bat/.csh file.

NOTE: For MS Windows users the unzip command is usually unavailable, hence:
first uncompress the black-box file using WinZip (or equivalent tool), then
copy/move the unzipped folder into this folder, then run the modified batch file.
