	<msg uid="1012" type="Error" text="Placement failed because of one or more of the following:\n\t1) There are too many $$s in the design.\n\t2) Too many $$s sites are occupied and/or prohibited for other purposes.\n\t3) There is an I/O banking rule conflict (such as Vccio/Vref) between different PIOs in the same bank.\nCheck the design and/or preferences carefully."/>
	<msg uid="1013" type="Error" text="ECLK PIO driver comp &quot;$$s&quot; has a DLLDEL attached to it. It requires a dedicated PCLK input pin; however it is placed on non-PCLK input pin &quot;$$s/$$s&quot;."/>

Reasons why the ECLK assignment failed: (1) it is possible that the dedicated clock input pins have been occupied by DDR2/DDR4 PIOs if the design has too many of them (note IDDR2/4 must be on bottm side, while ODDR2/4 must be on top side); (2) the clock input PIO drivers have I/O banking rule conflicts with the DDR2/DDR4 PIOs on the corresponding sides of the devices. Make sure that the design does not have these issues. "/>
