	<msg uid="1105" type="Status" text="INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC reset mode that has a limitation. The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. See the device specific datasheet for additional details."/>

Since the GSR is disabled for the EBR, make sure write enable and chip enable are inactive during wake-up, so that the pre-loaded initialization values will not be corrupted during wake-up state."/>
