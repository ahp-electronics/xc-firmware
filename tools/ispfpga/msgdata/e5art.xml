	<msg uid="1001" type="Warning" level="2" text="Secondary clock $$s has loads or driver cross to the other module. The skew cannot be guaranteed in the assembly flow."/>
	<msg uid="1002" type="Warning" level="2" text="Unknown CLK type."/>
	<msg uid="1003" type="Warning" level="2" text="Clock net $$s uses delayed mode. It will be routed using generic routing interconnect, and may suffer excessive delay or skew."/>
	<msg uid="1004" type="Warning" level="2" text="A remote spine is used for the normal clock net $$s because the spine local to the driver is occupied by another net or not able to route to all the loads through dedicated clock routing resource. This net may suffer from excessive delay or skew.
