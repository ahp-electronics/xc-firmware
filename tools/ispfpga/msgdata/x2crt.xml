    <msg uid="1001" type="Warning" level="2" text="Secondary clock $$s has loads or driver cross to other module. Its skew cannot be guaranteed in the assembly flow." />
    <msg uid="1002" type="Warning" level="2" text="Unknown CLK Type." />
    <msg uid="1003" type="Warning" level="2" text="Clock net $$s uses delayed mode. It will be routed using generic routing interconnect and might suffer from excessive delay or skew." />
    <msg uid="1004" type="Warning" level="2" text="A remote spine is used for the normal clock net $$s, because the spine local to the driver is occupied by another net or is not able to route to all/most loads through the dedicated clock routing resource. This net might suffer from excessive delay or skew. You might need to check your preference file to see if more than one clock net is driven from the same block of four PIO cells that share a clock spine." />
